# Earthquake-prediction-course-project
Earthquakes are seismic disturbances resulting from spontaneous energy release in the Earth's crust, causing shaking and waves that can lead to significant financial and physical damage. Among natural events, earthquakes pose a major threat, causing irreparable losses to both human lives and property. Therefore, predicting earthquakes plays a crucial role in preventing the loss of life and safeguarding communities.
In this project an attempt has been done to predict earthquake using historical earthquake data with the help of some Machine learning and Deep learning models.

# Dataset
The dataset contains all the earthquakes reported from 1930 to 2018. It was sourced from the United states 
Geological survey (USGS), which consisted of 7,97,046 data points and 22 columns

# Methods
LINEAR REGRESSIOM.
POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION.
